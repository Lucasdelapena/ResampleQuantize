This program is built off python 3 and is needed to run. You will also need to install opencv-python, and screeninfo. With this project my biggest issue was trying to get the upsampling to work, I think that was my biggest hurdle for the project. 

Sample execution:
 python Assignment3_CS4420.py -s 2 -d 5 -i 3 photo.png

installs:
pip install screen info
pip install opencv-python
