This script is an image sampling + quantization demo tool using OpenCV. It loads one image, shows the original, then downsamples it repeatedly, reduces intensity (color) precision, and finally upsamples it back so you can visually see the quality loss from sampling + quantization.

-s : Sampling Method (Must be 1 or 2)
    1 - pixel deletion / replication
    2 - averaging / interpolation

-d : (depth) how many times to downsample by 2 (each depth halves width + height) (input must be equal or greater than one)

-i : (intensity) controls quantization strength (1-7) fewer unique intensity values as it increases 

imagefile: path to the image file

Sample execution:
 python resampleQuantize.py -s 2 -d 5 -i 3 photo.png

installs:
pip install screen info
pip install opencv-python
